# Innovative Online Learning Platform

## Introduction

In today's digital age, many useful online courses are available, often for free. However, motivation can wane due to a lack of support and interaction. This project presents an **innovative online learning platform** designed to enhance collaborative learning, particularly in virtual environments where students may feel isolated.

## Goals

- **Connect Theory and Practice**: The platform bridges theoretical knowledge with real-world applications through group projects after course completion.
- **Skill Development**: It fosters essential skills like communication, teamwork, and problem-solving, preparing students for future IT careers.
- **Engaging Learning Experience**: Students can collaborate on projects, share ideas, and enjoy a more interactive learning environment.

## Features

- **Final Group Project**: Programming students will complete a final group project as part of their course requirements.
- **Team Structure**: Each team elects a leader to manage tasks using agile methodologies, with a dedicated group chat for discussions.
- **Task Management**: Tasks are tracked in a table with statuses: "to-do," "in progress," and "done."
- **Code Submission**: Team members submit their code, and the leader evaluates the final output in a code editor.

## Summary
